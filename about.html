          <p><span class="highlight">Travelfish says:</span><br>
          This area was originally home to a small fishing village with small seafood restaurants and simple accommodation for the adventurous traveller. 
          However, 20 years on and Telaga Harbour with its multitude of restaurants and shops has replaced the once sleepy village. Itâ€™s now a modern yacht harbour with a customs and immigration station and a boardwalk at Perdana Quay, anchored by the five-star Danna Hotel.
         Not only that, did you know that the beach is named after the Malay word for beach "Pantai" and "Kok" a local term in Langkawi.</p>
